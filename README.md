# Virtus Training
In this project I have created a new website for a functional fitness training club in the city of London. The website is designed to encompass the love of fitness with safe practices for healthy joints and over-all dynamic mobility that often is lacking in static weight-lifting. The website emphasises that all the trainers at Virtus are joint/mobility specilists so programs/classes will include fun and challanging dynamic movements. 

The site will target those individuals who seek to establish a community of fitness lovers that do not want to compromise on their joint health/mobility in the long run whilst working out. Virtus training will be usefull for all users who are new to functional fitness and are looking for more information as well as those fitness ethusiasts looking for a local funtional fitness community to be apart of.

## User Stories
* I identified 2 groups of user for this site, firstly, users that are new to funtional fitness and looking for more detailed information. Secondly, existing mobility/funtional fitness enthusiasts who are looking to join a local traning club.
    * ### New Users

# Design
## Layout:

- The layout is clean and minimalistic, giving it an elegant high end user experience. Pops of color to give the website some engery but still keeping inline with the luxury brand. The flow of the pages is well thought out keeping user experience at the center. The landing page garbs the users attention, gives breif information on the purpose of the website and its core values. 

The training pages, lays out the trainers info, programs and mobility classes offered then finally moving on to the sign up page. 



## Typography
* I used a combination of different styles of font to **emphasize** headings and categories. My main logo font is DM Serif Display. It gives the website a grand theme throught out the user experience.

* The hero video of my website features a bold statement in Arial Narrow Bold to stand out immedietly to the user and engage them from the start of the website.

* Any other text that was used throughout the site has a font of 'lato'. I chose this font because it has a minimalistic and mordern feel to it.

## Colour Scheme

- The site's primary colours are black and white with accents of orange,oxford blue and platinum. The above image shows the original colour section for the site. All colours were picked and matched from [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/).

- The use of these colors was to give the website a luxury high-end feel to it while keeping everything minimal and chic and also being readable to all users.
