# Virtus Training

* [live link](https://hammad25.github.io/virtus-training-club/) of the project

In this project, I have created a new website for a functional fitness training club in the city of London. The website is designed to encompass the love of fitness with safe practices for healthy joints and overall dynamic mobility that often is lacking in static weight-lifting. The website emphasizes that all the trainers at Virtus are joint/mobility specialists so programs/classes will include fun and challenging dynamic movements.
The site will target those individuals who seek to establish a community of fitness lovers that do not want to compromise on their joint health/mobility in the long run whilst working out. Virtus training will be useful for all users who are new to functional fitness and are looking for more information as well as those fitness enthusiasts looking for a local functional fitness community to be a part of.

# Design
## Layout:

* The layout is clean and minimalistic, giving it an elegant high-end user experience. Pops of color to give the website some energy but still, keep in line with the luxury brand. The flow of the pages is well thought out keeping the user experience at the center. 

* The landing page grabs the user's attention, gives brief information on the purpose of the website and its core values.

## Typography
* I used a combination of different styles of font to **emphasize** headings and categories. My main logo font is DM Serif Display. It gives the website a grand theme throughout the user experience.

* the hero video of my website features a bold statement in Arial Narrow Bold to stand out immediately to the user and engage them from the start of the website.

* Any other text that was used throughout the site has a font of 'lato'. I chose this font because it has a minimalistic and modern feel to it.

## Colour Scheme

*  The site's primary colors are black and white with accents of orange, oxford blue, and platinum. The above image shows the original color section for the site. All colors were picked and matched from [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/).

* The use of these colors was to give the website a luxury high-end feel it while keeping everything minimal and chic and also being readable to all users.
